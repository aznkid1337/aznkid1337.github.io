<h1>Awesome websites</h1>
<h2>Here are some websites that I personally use on a daily basis.</h2>
<DIV>Cool Math Games is a website that I hold dear to my heart. It's always been there for me ever since I was in middle school and was bored in class. On this website, you can play some simple, fun flash games to pass the time. Some of them are also very educational. I would highly recommend it!</DIV>

<DIV>Youtube is a unique website that allows anyone to create video content for the entire world. I use it a lot to watch videos that interest me. Some of my favorite Youtube channels/creators are Binging with Babish, TheOdd1sOut, and videogamedunkey.</DIV>

<DIV>Reddit is commonly known as "The Front Page of The Internet". It's a website that acts as a hub for forums of various communities. On these forums, people share thoughts and ideas about the community topic. If you have any hobbies or things that interest you, there's most likely a community on Reddit just for that. Even if there isn't, you can create a community yourself on Reddit. The communities can range from politics and world news, to funny cat videos. It's definitely worth the time to check it out.</DIV>

<DIV>Netflix is a streaming websites with a bunch of movies and TV shows to watch. It does require a payment on a monthly basis in order to watch, so have some form of electronic payment if you want to sign up for a Netflix account. Some of the stuff I love to binge-watch are The Office, Planet Earth, and The Full Metal Alchemist.</DIV>
